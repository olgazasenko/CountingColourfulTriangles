# CountingColourfulTriangles
First (naive) implementation of the algorithm that counts the number of colourful triangular containments (part of my Master's Thesis).

Consider the problem of computing the colourful simplicial depth of
a point x in two-dimensional space relative to a configuration
of three colour sets (blue, green, and red) of n points in total. 
The colourful simplicial depth of x is exactly the number of
triangles with vertices from 3 different colour classes that contain
x in their convex hull.
